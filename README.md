<h3>About me:</h3>
<p> Welcome to the mind-blowing adventure! In this amazing universe I call home, anything is possible and fun is guaranteed. I'm a true tech lover, a fearless explorer of the wonders of robotics and programming. I'm currently working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but make no mistake... I'm a master of the "amateur gamer" stuff!
Oh, but don't think I'm just a cloistered geek. I am an adventurer of two worlds: both Linux and Windows are part of my repertoire. I'm a hero without a cape, navigating the virtual oceans in search of challenges and innovations</P>
